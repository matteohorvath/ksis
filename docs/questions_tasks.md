Okay, I will rewrite the questions from `docs/questions.md` in a more technical manner based on the provided `docs/database_schema.md`, and then outline a mathematical/statistical approach for each.

Here's the breakdown:

---

**Original Question 1:** `what is the likelihood that somebody will wil?`

**Technical Rewrite:**
Calculate the probability of a specific `participant` achieving a first-place `Result.position` in a given `Event` or `Event` type, based on their historical performance data.

**Mathematical/Statistical Approach:**
1.  **Define "Win":** A "win" is defined as `Result.position = '1'` for a `participant` in a specific `Event`. We may need to consider the `Round.name` (e.g., "Final") if applicable.
2.  **Identify Relevant Data:**
    *   Filter the `Result` table for the `participantId` of interest.
    *   Further filter by `eventId` if predicting for a specific upcoming event, or by `Event.competitionId` and `Event.name` (e.g., "Latin Open") to consider similar past events.
3.  **Calculate Historical Win Rate (Simple Probability):**
    *   \( P(\text{Win}) = \frac{\text{Number of times participant achieved Result.position = '1' in relevant events}}{\text{Total number of relevant events participated in}} \)
4.  **Advanced Approach (Predictive Modeling):**
    *   Gather features for each `Result` entry for the participant and potentially their competitors:
        *   Participant's past average `position`.
        *   Number of participants in the `Event`.
        *   Historical `Mark.proposedPlacement` from `judges`.
        *   `Event` characteristics (e.g., `location` from `Competition`).
    *   Use a classification model (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, or more complex models like Gradient Boosting) to predict the probability of `Result.position = '1'`.
    *   The model would be trained on historical data of many participants and events.

**Original Question 2:** `what is the score of a couple , compared to other couples?`

**Technical Rewrite:**
Determine the relative performance ranking of a given `participant` (couple) within a specific `Event` and `Round` by comparing their `Result.position` or an aggregated metric derived from `Mark.proposedPlacement` against other `participants` in the same context.

**Mathematical/Statistical Approach:**
1.  **Identify Target Context:** Specify the `eventId` and `roundId`.
2.  **Method 1: Using `Result.position`:**
    *   Retrieve all `Result` entries for the given `eventId`.
    *   Identify the `Result.position` for the target `participant`.
    *   Compare this `position` directly with the `position` of other `participants` in the same `Event`. Lower is better.
    *   **Relative Ranking:** Calculate percentile rank:
        \[ \text{Percentile Rank} = \frac{\text{Number of participants with worse or equal position}}{\text{Total number of participants}} \times 100 \]
        (Adjust formula if lower position is better, e.g., (Total - Rank + 1) / Total)

3.  **Method 2: Using `Mark.proposedPlacement`:**
    *   For the specified `roundId` and `eventId`:
        *   For each `participantId` in that round, retrieve all associated `Mark` entries.
        *   Calculate an aggregate placement for each participant from all `judges` in that round (e.g., mean, median, or sum of `Mark.proposedPlacement`). This is commonly done using the Skating System rules for dance competitions, which involves a more complex aggregation than a simple mean.
    *   **Comparison:**
        *   Rank participants based on this aggregated `Mark.proposedPlacement`.
        *   Calculate differences or ratios of these aggregated scores.
        *   Z-scores: If a distribution of scores is available:
            \[ Z_{participant} = \frac{\text{Score}_{participant} - \mu_{\text{scores}}}{\sigma_{\text{scores}}} \]
            where \(\mu\) is the mean and \(\sigma\) is the standard deviation of the aggregated scores for all participants in that round.

**Original Question 3:** `in an upcoming competition, which judge is in favor and which is not for a couple?`

**Technical Rewrite:**
For a specific `participant` (couple) and an upcoming `Event` (identified by `eventId` or `competitionId`), analyze historical `Mark` data to identify which `judges` (from the `judges` table, linked via `_EventToJudge`) have historically assigned significantly better or worse `Mark.proposedPlacement` to this `participant` compared to a baseline (e.g., the participant's average placement from other judges or their final `Result.position`).

**Mathematical/Statistical Approach:**
1.  **Identify Data:**
    *   Target `participantId`.
    *   Historical `Mark` entries where `Mark.participantId` matches the target.
    *   Corresponding `Mark.judgeId`, `Mark.roundId`, `Mark.proposedPlacement`.
    *   Corresponding `Result.position` for the participant in those same `Round`s/`Event`s.
2.  **Define "Favoritism/Anti-Favoritism" Metric per Judge for the Participant:**
    *   For each (`judgeId`, `participantId`) pair across multiple historical `Round`s:
        *   **Metric 1: Deviation from Participant's Average Placement (excluding current judge):**
            For each round judged by judge J for participant P:
            Let \(P_{avg\_others}\) be the average `Mark.proposedPlacement` given to P by other judges in that round.
            Let \(P_J\) be the `Mark.proposedPlacement` given by judge J to P.
            `Bias_J_P_round = P_{avg_others} - P_J` (Positive means J scores P better).
            Average this `Bias_J_P_round` across all rounds judged by J for P.
        *   **Metric 2: Deviation from Final Result:**
            `Bias_J_P_round = Result.position_P_round - Mark.proposedPlacement_J_P_round`
            (Positive value indicates the judge placed the participant better than their final result).
            Average this `Bias_J_P_round` over all rounds where judge J marked participant P.
3.  **Statistical Significance:**
    *   For each judge, test if their average bias score for the participant is significantly different from zero (or a threshold) using a t-test.
    *   The set of judges for the "upcoming competition" can be found by linking `Competition` -> `Event` -> `_EventToJudge` -> `judges`. Then apply the historical bias analysis for these specific judges.

**Original Question 4:** `who was more favoured, zero, and more negative in scoring compared to the results of the couple? two category , final, and all prefinal rounds.`

**Technical Rewrite:**
For a specific `participant` (couple), identify `judges` whose average `Mark.proposedPlacement` for this `participant` significantly deviates from the `participant`'s actual `Result.position`. Categorize this deviation as:
    a.  Favorable Bias: Judge's average `Mark.proposedPlacement` is statistically significantly lower (better) than the `Result.position`.
    b.  Neutral Scoring: Judge's average `Mark.proposedPlacement` is not statistically significantly different from the `Result.position`.
    c.  Unfavorable Bias: Judge's average `Mark.proposedPlacement` is statistically significantly higher (worse) than the `Result.position`.
This analysis should be performed separately for:
    i.  Final `Round`s (e.g., `Round.name` LIKE '%Final%').
    ii. All pre-final `Round`s.

**Mathematical/Statistical Approach:**
1.  **Data Segmentation:**
    *   Filter `Mark` and `Result` data for the specific `participantId`.
    *   Join `Mark` with `Round` to identify `Round.name`.
    *   Separate data into two sets:
        *   Final rounds (e.g., `Round.name` matches 'Final', 'Finale', etc.).
        *   Pre-final rounds (all other rounds for that event).
2.  **Calculate Deviation per Judge, per Round Category:**
    *   For each judge who has marked the participant:
        *   For each segment (final, pre-final):
            *   Collect all pairs of (`Mark.proposedPlacement` by this judge, `Result.position` for the participant) in rounds within this segment.
            *   Calculate the differences: `Deviation_ijk = Mark.proposedPlacement_ijk - Result.position_ik` (where i=participant, j=judge, k=round).
            *   Calculate the average deviation for judge `j` for participant `i` within the segment: \(\bar{D}_{ij\_segment}\).
3.  **Statistical Testing and Categorization:**
    *   For each judge and each segment:
        *   Perform a one-sample t-test (or Wilcoxon signed-rank test if normality is not assumed) on the set of deviations to test if \(\bar{D}_{ij\_segment}\) is significantly different from 0.
        *   **Categorize based on p-value and sign of \(\bar{D}_{ij\_segment}\):**
            *   **Favorable Bias:** \(\bar{D}_{ij\_segment} < 0\) and p-value < \(\alpha\) (e.g., 0.05). (Judge places them better than they finish)
            *   **Unfavorable Bias:** \(\bar{D}_{ij\_segment} > 0\) and p-value < \(\alpha\). (Judge places them worse than they finish)
            *   **Neutral Scoring:** p-value \(\geq \alpha\).

**Original Question 5:** `which judge favors, or zero, or antifavors which couple?`

**Technical Rewrite:**
For every `participant` (couple) that has been scored by multiple `judges`, and for each `judge` who has scored them, determine if the judge exhibits a statistically significant pattern of favorable, neutral, or unfavorable bias in their `Mark.proposedPlacement` relative to either:
    a) The average `Mark.proposedPlacement` given by other judges to that same `participant` in the same `Round`s.
    b) The `participant`'s final `Result.position` in those `Round`s.

**Mathematical/Statistical Approach:**
This is an extension of Questions 3 and 4, applied systematically across all participant-judge pairs.

1.  **Iterate through Participants:** For each `participantId` in the `participants` table.
2.  **Iterate through Judges who marked that Participant:** For each `participant`, identify all `judgeId`s from the `Mark` table who have submitted a `Mark.proposedPlacement` for them.
3.  **Calculate Bias Metric per (Participant, Judge) Pair:**
    *   Choose a bias definition (as in Q3 or Q4, e.g., deviation from final result, or deviation from average of other judges).
    *   For a participant `P` and a judge `J`:
        *   Collect all `Round`s where `J` marked `P`.
        *   Calculate the chosen bias metric for each of these instances.
        *   Example (using deviation from final result): `Bias_PJ_round = Mark.proposedPlacement_PJ_round - Result.position_P_round`.
4.  **Aggregate and Test for Significance:**
    *   For each (`P`, `J`) pair, calculate the average bias: \(\overline{\text{Bias}}_{PJ}\).
    *   Perform a statistical test (e.g., one-sample t-test on the collected bias values for this pair) to determine if \(\overline{\text{Bias}}_{PJ}\) is significantly different from 0.
5.  **Categorize and Report:**
    *   Based on the sign of \(\overline{\text{Bias}}_{PJ}\) and the p-value:
        *   If \(\overline{\text{Bias}}_{PJ} < 0\) and p-value < \(\alpha\): Judge `J` favors participant `P`.
        *   If \(\overline{\text{Bias}}_{PJ} > 0\) and p-value < \(\alpha\): Judge `J` anti-favors (is unfavorable to) participant `P`.
        *   Otherwise (p-value \(\geq \alpha\)): Judge `J` has zero (neutral) bias towards participant `P`.
    *   The output would be a list or table where each row might be (`participant.name`, `judge.name`, `BiasCategory`, `AverageBiasValue`, `P-value`).
